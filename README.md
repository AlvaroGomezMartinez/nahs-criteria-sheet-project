# NAHS CRITERIA SHEET PROJECT

The objective of this project is to have a Google Spreadsheet that provides an estimated days left value using a custom function (see funcs.gs) in Column L. The Google Spreadsheet will also be used to populate separate sheets that separates students for each counselor based on their caseload.<br><br>
