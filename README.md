# NAHS Criteria Sheet Project
The objective of this project is to have a web app where a clerk can fill out registration information for newly enrolled students. The data from the web app will populate in a Google Spreadsheet. The Google Spreadsheet will process estimated days left in their placement. The Google Spreadsheet will also be used to populate separate sheets for counselors to use.<br><br>
