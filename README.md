# NAHS CRITERIA SHEET PROJECT

The objective of this project is to have a web app where a clerk can fill out registration information for newly enrolled students. The clerk clicks on a user interface called "Add a Student" that is located in the menu bar. When "Add a Student" is clicked, a sidebar opens up inside the Google Sheet. The sidebar is a form where the clerk enters the information when the new student registers. Once the data is entered, the Google Spreadsheet will process estimated days left in their placement using a custom function (see funcs.gs) in Column J. The Google Spreadsheet will also be used to populate separate sheets that separates students for each counselor based on their caseload.<br><br>
